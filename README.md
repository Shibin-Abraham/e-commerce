# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

Open your terminal and then type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shibin-Abraham/e-commerce.git

cd tastebite
```

Then enter the following commands:

```bash
npm install vite@latest
```
after the insatllation type:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/e-commerce] with your browser to see the result.
